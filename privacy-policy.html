					<br />
					Kervale is committed to providing quality services to you and this policy outlines our ongoing <br />
obligations to you in respect of how we manage your Personal Information. <br />
<br />
We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) <br />

<br />and dispose of your Personal Information.<br />
<br />
A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained from the website of The Office of the <br />

What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?<br />
<br />
Personal Information is information or an opinion that identifies an individual. Examples of <br />

available sources, from cookies and from third parties. We don’t <br />
guarantee website links or policy of authorised third parties.<br />
<br />

We collect your Personal Information for the primary purpose of providing our services to you, <br />
providing information to our clients and marketing. We may also use your <br />
Personal Information for secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose, in circumstances where you <br />
would reasonably expect such use or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our mailing/marketing <br />
lists at any time by contacting us in writing.<br />
<br />

When we collect Personal Information we will, where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why <br />
we are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.<br />

<br />
• For the primary purpose for which it was obtained<br />
• For a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose<br />
• With your consent; or where required or authorised by law.<br />
<br />
Third Parties<br />
<br />
Where reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect your Personal Information only from you. <br />
However, in some circumstances we may be provided with information by third parties. In such a case we will take <br />
reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of the information provided to us by the third party.<br />
